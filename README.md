## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danish975/StudyQ-Collaborative-Doubt-Solving-Platform.git
cd StudyQ-Collaborative-Doubt-Solving-Platform
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (you can copy `.env.example` if available) and add the following:
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SQLite for local development
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

### 3. Database Setup (Local)
Generate the Prisma client and push the schema to create your local SQLite database:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

*(Optional)* Seed the database with demo data:
```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🗄️ Database Management
To view and manage your database locally, run Prisma Studio:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
This opens a visual database browser at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555).

## 🌍 Production Deployment
When deploying to a production environment (like Render or Vercel), update your `.env` to use your remote PostgreSQL connection strings:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/db_name?sslmode=require"
```
And make sure to update your `prisma/schema.prisma` provider to `postgresql`.
